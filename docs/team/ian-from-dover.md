### Summary of Contributions

* **Role in team**: Team leader and frontend developer
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to open the User Guide directly in the web browser. (Pull Request [\#77](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/77))
  * **What it does**: allows the user to open the User Guide directly in the web browser.
  * **Justification**: This feature improves the product because it significantly reduces the number of steps a user needs to do to search for help. It also follows Jakob Nielsen's Revised Usability Heuristic H2-10: Help and documentation.
  * **Highlights**: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
