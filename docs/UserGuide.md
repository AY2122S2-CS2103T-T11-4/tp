Welcome to PeopleSoft!

PeopleSoft is a desktop application for **calculating the salary for shift-based contractors**, optimized for use via a **command-line interface (CLI)**. If you are a **HR manager** and you can type fast, PeopleSoft can get your payroll tasks done **much faster** than traditional graphical user interface (GUI) applications.

You can input your employees' data and the jobs that you want to keep track of.
Then, you can assign the employees to the jobs that they are working on.
After the job is completed, you can mark the job as paid, and PeopleSoft will calculate how much each employee is to be paid based on their hourly rates.
You can also generate a payslip in comma-separated values (CSV) format for you and your employees to refer to.

PeopleSoft simulates a real life workflow:
  * The company receives a new job.
  * The HR manager `add`s the job to PeopleSoft, and `assign`s employees to work on it.
  * The employees start working. 
  * When the employees complete the job, the HR manager `mark`s the job as completed.
  * Once it is time to pay the employees, `pay` out the job and `export` the payslips for the employees.

## Quick start

### Running PeopleSoft for the first time

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your computer. Follow [**this guide**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) to do so.

2. **Download** the latest version of `peoplesoft.jar` from [**here**](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/releases).

3. Place the `peoplesoft.jar` file anywhere on your computer (preferably within a new folder, as the configuration and data files will be stored in the same location).

4. **Double-click** the file to start PeopleSoft. A window (similar to the one below) should appear shortly.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** If double-clicking the file does not start PeopleSoft, then open the command line interpreter for your system (e.g. Command Prompt or Windows Terminal on Windows, or Terminal on macOS and Linux), navigate to directory where the file is located (e.g. with `cd path/to/folder`), and run `java -jar peoplesoft.jar`.

</figcaption>

When PeopleSoft is started for the first time, it will be populated with sample data. You may delete this data with the `clear` command.

A `data` folder and some configuration files (with a `.json` extension) will also be created in the folder that you run `peoplesoft.jar` from; this is where PeopleSoft data will be stored.

### Processing your first payment using the sample data

The sample data is meant to help users get started with PeopleSoft. This is a tutorial of some of the basic features of PeopleSoft using the sample data. As such, it is not a comprehensive overview of every feature in PeopleSoft. You can refer to the [features](#features) section for more information about specific features.

To start off, notice that the sample data contains some employees under the list of employees. Here, you can see the details of the employees, including their name, base pay and tags.

Since the sample data does not include any jobs, we will need to create new ones.

#### Create a job

When your company receives a new job, you can add it to PeopleSoft. To create a job, you can use the `add` command. You will have to specify a name and duration using the `n/` and `d/` prefixes respectively. For this tutorial, we will create a 2-hour-long aircon repair job.

1. Type `add n/Repair aircon d/2` in the command window.

    This command will add a new job with the name "Repair aircon" and a duration of two hours.

    <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

    **:information_source: Note:** The attributes prefixed by `n/` and `d/` can be in any order.

    </div>

2. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    ![Added repair Aircon](images/screenshots/tut_add.png)

    <figcaption 
        style="text-align: center; 
               font-style: italic;"> 
        A job with the name "Repair aircon" and a duration of two hours is created in the job list
    </figcaption>
<br>

#### Assign person to a job

PeopleSoft allows you to indicate which employees are in-charge of a certain job with the `assign` command. The `assign` command requires 1 job *index*, and at least 1 employee *index* (each prefixed by `i/`). These indexes can be found under the `#` column in both lists.

1. Type `assign 1 i/1` in the command window.

    The first number in the command (`1`) refers to the *index* of the job. In this case, it refers to the first job in the list of jobs, which is the aircon repair job created earlier.

    The prefix `i/` denotes the index of the employee to be assigned to the job. In this case, it references the first employee in the list of employees, which is "Nicole Tan". Additional employees can also be assigned to this job by adding additional `i/` attributes.

2. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    A message should appear, indicating that the job "Repair aircon" is assigned to "Nicole Tan".

    ![Assigned to nicole](images/screenshots/tut_asgn.png)

    <figcaption 
        style="text-align: center; 
               font-style: italic;"> 
        Nicole Tan is assigned to the "Repair aircon" job
    </figcaption>
<br>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:** Index-based commands depend on the ordering of the items displayed in their respective lists. The search and list commands for employees and jobs can cause this order to vary.

</div>

<br>

#### Find employees who are qualified

1. Type `personfind aircon` in the command window.

    This command searches for "aircon" in the names or tags of employees. Search terms are not case-sensitive.

2. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    There should be two persons listed: "Nicole Tan", and "Arjun Khatau". Notice that the list of employees now only shows employees with the "Aircon" tag.

   ![Find people with the "Aircon" tag](images/screenshots/tut_find.png)

    <figcaption 
        style="text-align: center; 
               font-style: italic;"> 
        Nicole and Arjun are have the "Aircon" tag
    </figcaption>
<br>

3. Type `assign 1 i/2` in the command window.

    This assigns the second person in the list (Arjun Khatau) to the first job. Notice that the employee index (2) now refers to the second employee in the current list (Arjun Khatau), instead of in the original list (Kavya Singh).

4. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    A message should appear, indicating that the job "Repair aircon" is assigned to "Arjun Khatau".

#### Complete a job and pay employees

A key feature of PeopleSoft is tracking the state of job completion and whether its payment has been processed; this can be done with the `mark` and `pay` commands, respectively.

1. Type `mark 1` in the command window.

    This command marks the first job as completed.

2. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    The job "Repair aircon" should be marked as completed, and a checkmark ![tick](images/apple-tick-emoji.png) should appear under the *Done* column.

Marking a job as completed creates pending payments for the job. The amounts pending payment are reflected in the *Unpaid* column in the employees list.

Now that the "Repair aircon" job has been marked as completed, "Nicole Tan" and "Arjun Khatau" should have non-zero values under the *Unpaid* column.

This value reflects the amount of money that is pending payment to the employees. It is calculated from the employee's base rate and the job's duration.

1. Type `pay 1 y/` in the command window. 

    The prefix `y/` is a safeguard against accidental misuse of this command. This command finalizes payments for the given job, and is **irreversible**. After the job is finalized, it cannot be further modified, so do make sure that you intend to run this command before running it.

2. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    The payments for the job is now finalized, indicating that the employees have been paid for the job. This is also reflected in the checkmark ![tick](images/apple-tick-emoji.png) under the *Paid* column.

   ![Mark and pay](images/screenshots/tut_markpay.png)

    <figcaption 
        style="text-align: center; 
               font-style: italic;"> 
        The job list after the job is marked as done and payments are finalised
    </figcaption>
<br>

#### Export employee payslips

PeopleSoft also allows users to export a payslip for each employee as a comma-separated values (CSV) spreadsheet.

1. Type `export 1` in the command window.

    This command exports the payslip for the first employee (Nicole Tan) to a CSV spreadsheet.

2. Hit **Enter** to run the command.

    The payslip beginning with the employee's name is now saved in the PeopleSoft `data` folder.

![Location of the data folder](images/screenshots/data_folder.png)

<figcaption 
    style="text-align: center; 
           font-style: italic;"> 
    Exported employee data can be found under the data folder
</figcaption>

This concludes the tutorial on the basic usage of PeopleSoft. You can refer to the [features](#features) section for more information about specific features. To clear the sample data, run the `clear` command.

    Parts of a command in PeopleSoft
</figcaption>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the attributes to be filled in by you.<br>
  e.g. in `personadd n/NAME`, `NAME` can be replaced with an actual name like in `personadd n/John Doe`.

* Attributes can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command asks for `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also fine.

* If an attribute is expected only once but is typed multiple times, only the last occurrence of the attribute will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/Jake n/Jason`, only `n/Jason` will be taken.

* For commands that do not need attributes (like `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), anything typed after the command word will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be specified as `n/John Doe t/friend` or `n/John Doe`.

* Items with ellipses (`...​`) after them indicate that the items can be repeated any number of times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...​` can be interpreted as `[t/TAG]`, `[t/TAG] [t/TAG]`, and so on.

## Features

### Employee-related commands

#### `personadd`: Add an employee

Adds a new employee to the system with the given attributes.

Rate refers to the hourly pay of the employee.

Format: `personadd n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS r/RATE [t/TAG]...`

Examples:

* `personadd n/Nicole Tan p/99338558 e/nicole@stffhub.org a/1 Tech Drive, S138572 r/37.50 t/Hardware t/Senior` will create a new employee with name "Nicole Tan", phone number "99338558", email "nicole@stffhub.org", address "1 Tech Drive, S138572", an hourly rate of $37.50, and with tags "Hardware" and "Senior".
* `personadd n/Jennifer Tan p/88473219 e/jennifer@stffhub.org a/13 Tech Drive, S182562 r/25` will create a new employee with name "Jennifer Tan", phone number "88473219", email "jennifer@stffhub.org", address "13 Tech Drive, S182562", an hourly rate of $25. No tags will be added since it is an optional attribute.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Attributes containing `/` are not accepted. Replace `/` with another character (e.g. `-`) if any attribute contains `/`.

  For example: Use `Ravi s-o Veegan` instead of `Ravi s/o Veegan`, and `3-5 Jalan Trus` instead of `3/5 Jalan Trus`.

* The maximum value for the hourly rate of an employee is $1,000,000.

</div>

[Return to the Table of Contents](#toc)

#### `personedit`: Edit an employee's information

Edit the information of an existing employee. Use this in the event that an employee's details change.

Rate updates will only take effect with jobs that are pending completion; payout amounts for already-completed (i.e. marked with `mark`) jobs will not change.

Format: `personedit PERSON_INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [r/RATE] [t/TAG]...​`

Examples:

* `personedit 2 p/62353535` changes the second person's phone number to 62353535.
* `personedit 3 t/Hardware t/Network` changes the third person's tags to "Hardware" and "Network" instead of their original tags.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* Attributes containing `/` are not accepted. Replace `/` with another character (e.g. `-`) if any attribute contains `/`.

  For example: Use `Ravi s-o Veegan` instead of `Ravi s/o Veegan`, and `3-5 Jalan Trus` instead of `3/5 Jalan Trus`.

* The maximum value for the hourly rate of an employee is $1,000,000.

* When editing tags, new tags will **not** be added to the existing tags. Instead, all existing tags will be replaced by new tags.

* To clear all tags, add `t/` to the command without specifying any other tags.

</div>

### Job-related commands

#### `add`: Add a job

Adds a new job with the given attributes. `DURATION` refers to the duration required for the job, in hours.

Format: `add n/NAME d/DURATION`

Examples:

* `add n/Fix HDB Lock d/1` creates a job named "Fix HDB Lock" with a duration of 1 hour.
* `add n/Repair aircon d/4` creates a job named "Repair aircon" with a duration of 4 hours.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

* The maximum value for the duration of a job is 1,000,000 hours.

* Multiple jobs of the same name can be added. These jobs can then be differentiated by their internal ID, the order in which they were added, and the employees that were assigned to it, although practically it can easily result in confusion. It is thus recommended that a user differentiates jobs through naming to avoid any confusion.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

A job that has been [marked](#mark-mark-or-unmark-a-job-as-done) as completed cannot be assigned. If a job is completed, it makes little sense to assign more employees to it. In the event more employees need to be assigned to a job, unmark the job first before assigning them.

</div>

[Return to the Table of Contents](#toc)

#### `mark`: Mark or unmark a job as done

Marks a job as done if it was not already marked as done, or marks a job as undone otherwise.

Marking a job as done indicates that a job has been completed and is pending payment. Unmarking a job causes the pending payment amounts to be subtracted from assigned employees.

Jobs are initially **not** marked as done when first created, and have to have at least one person [assigned](#assign-assign-a-job-to-an-employee) to it before it can be marked.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

The hourly rate(s) paid out to each employee for a job is fixed once the job is marked as done; further changes to any employee's rate will not cause the payout amounts to change.

To update the payout amounts to reflect the new hourly rates, unmark and mark the job again.

</div>

Format: `mark JOB_INDEX`

Examples:

* `mark 1` marks the first job, assuming it is not already marked as done.
* `mark 1` unmarks the first job if it has already been marked as done.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Caution:**<br>

This is irreversible. The finalized job cannot be modified in any way, and can only be removed with [`clear`](#clear-clear-all-peoplesoft-data).

</div>

Format: `pay JOB_INDEX y/`

Example: `pay 2 y/` finalizes the payments of the second job

## FAQ

**Q**: I'm using macOS and I can't double-click on the `peoplesoft.jar` file to open it. What should I do? 

**A**: Follow the steps stated [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/353) to open your `jar` file.

<br>

**Q**: What are the `addressbook.log.0`, `config.json`, `preferences.json` files beside my `peoplesoft.jar`? 

**A**: PeopleSoft uses the settings inside those files to run. For instance, the height and width of PeopleSoft is stored in those files. Do not remove or edit those files.

<br>

**Q**: How do I save my data?

**A**: PeopleSoft automatically saves application data to the folder that it was started from after every command. There is no need to save manually.

<br>

**Q**: How can I edit PeopleSoft data manually?

**A**: PeopleSoft data is saved as a JSON file under `data/peoplesoft.json` in the folder that it was started from. It is possible (although not recommended) to modify application data by editing that file.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Caution:**<br>

Do not edit the data directly unless you know what you are doing. If your changes cause the data file to become invalid, PeopleSoft will discard all data and start with an empty data file the next time it is started.

</div>

<br>

**Q**: Can I get back the initial sample data?

**A**: Deleting the `data/peoplesoft.json` file and restarting PeopleSoft will cause the sample data to be reloaded.

<br>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Install PeopleSoft on the other computer and overwrite the `data/peoplesoft.json` file it creates with your existing `data/peoplesoft.json` file.

<br>

**Q**: How do I report a bug? How do I suggest a feature?

**A**: You may report a bug or suggest a new feature on the [PeopleSoft issue tracker](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues).
